#  2023年市场的秘诀，后疫情和人群的思考，一些杂七杂八的碎碎念 The secret of the market in 2023, the thinking of the post-epidemic and the crowd, and some miscellaneous thoughts

## 市场的秘诀 The secret of the market
Looking back to 2022, it is an unusual year for the domestic B2B market - offline downtime looms from time to time, B2B enterprises cannot communicate with users face to face stably, and B2B marketers have a deeper perception of the failure of traditional marketing methods.
B2B businesses are facing a new round of change. Under such circumstances, why should we sign a contract with Spark?
The answer is simple, that is, they make the demands of enterprise users become the creators of content through a series of effective marketing methods.
The so-called marketing is actually an act. People's perception of marketing is wrong. In fact, so-called marketing is an act. If the purpose and process of this behavior is to spread the brand and word of mouth of some enterprise products.
Whether you say that marketing is wrong or not, marketing is an action that needs to be implemented by someone. Every time in the dissemination, there are certain skills in it.
This behavior is to let some brands and products gain more recognition by means of communication. As long as you can let others use your product, you will succeed.
Marketing is not only to promote products, but also to promote some brands.

回望 2022 年，对于国内的 B2B 市场而言是不普通的一年——线下停摆时隐时现，B2B 企业无法与用户稳定地面对面交流，B2B 营销人对传统营销方式失效的感知愈加深刻。



B2B 商家面临了新一轮的变革，在这样的情况下，为什么我们要采取和星火签约合作？

答案很简单，那就是他们通过一系列有效的营销手段，让企业用户的诉求成为了内容的创造者。

所谓营销，其实是一种行为。人们对于营销的认知是错误的，其实所谓的营销是一种行为。而如果这个行为的目的和过程是将一些企业产品的品牌和口碑传播出去。



不管你说营销这个行为是不是错误的，但营销是一个需要有人去实施的行为。每一次在传播的时候，都是有一定的技巧在其中的。

这个行为就是用传播的方式来让一些品牌和产品获得更多的认可。只要能够让别人去使用你的产品，那么你就成功了。

营销不仅仅是要将产品推销出去，更多的营销还需要将一些品牌推广出去。

Hundreds of theories have been put forward on the rise and fall of the economy, namely the so-called economic cycle: changes in the money supply, the amount of inventories, and changes in world trade caused by government orders, consumer attitudes, capital expenditures, and even the juxtaposition of sunspots and planets. Pigou, the British economist, simplified it as human balance. Pigou believed that the ups and downs of the economy were caused by excessive optimism and subsequent pessimism. If the economy moves too far in one direction, there will be surplus, while if it moves too far in the other direction, there will be shortage. The excess in one direction leads to the excess in the other direction, so the relaxation and contraction will never stop.

In the past 150 years, globalization - the growth of cross-border flows of products, services, data, capital and labor - has swept the world, sweeping every country, city and family. All this is not the limit. But before globalization is complete, there are many enemies. In order to obtain long-term commercial value, these enemies must be eliminated first.
After the tests of war, economic depression and trade protectionism, globalization has become invincible, and has bounced back with new vitality and influence. Just like in the Second World War, the United States won a great victory in the Pacific War and became the most powerful country in the world at that time.

Economic hegemony can change from a small country to a huge one in an instant, or it can fall to another more powerful country in a short time.
The fight for economic hegemony is sometimes just a show of hands vote by one of the countries, but it makes others feel scared.
Thanks to the promotion of transnational corporations and their global supply chains, the past 30 years have been the period with the highest degree of globalization. In this mode, the company obtains parts and raw materials from suppliers around the world, assembles them into final products in low-cost manufacturing centers such as Mexico, China and Poland, and then exports them to Wal Mart in St. Louis and Apple Store in San Francisco for sale to customers there. When describing the globalization of this kind of production, the World Trade Organization pointed out that "made in China" or "made in the United States" has become the past, and now only "made in the world"“

"World manufacturing" is also considered as a kind of "anarchism" manufacturing. In the development of industrialization, disputes between countries become less and less, and this kind of anarchism manufacturing has become a kind of "anarchism" manufacturing.
Therefore, this word is not a reference. In the United States, "made in the world" refers to products made by Americans themselves, including cars, airplanes, computers, mobile phones, etc. In the United States, "made in the world" is considered as a reference.
As we know, globalization is gradually disappearing in the long river of history. It reveals that the ongoing technology-driven transformation is not a small fight. They are changing the whole paradigm of globalization, changing the long-existing "word" or saving a generation's traditional view of globalization and its impact. These views include: the huge global supply chain breeds "made in the world" products; It is difficult for small enterprises to export because of high fixed costs; The facilitation of border trade is the key to promote the increase of trade volume; wait. Over the past 30 years, such views - all of which are of course correct and have been widely studied - have affected hundreds of major trade policy decisions, thousands of academic and policy papers, countless policymakers and hundreds of billions of dollars in development assistance.

However, these views have a fatal flaw: they have never considered a more important issue:
Why is world trade becoming more and more difficult?
In fact, this is a very simple question. We just need to think about it to get the answer: world trade is growing faster and faster, and the volume of trade is also increasing.
This is a very important issue, because it is related to whether we can grasp the direction of the world economy.
Most scholars believe that the growth rate of the world economy is slow.
However, from another perspective, we can now explain why the economic growth rate will be faster.
There are two reasons. First, in the process of globalization, we have made very important achievements in industry and agriculture.

For example, in the process of globalization, industry has made great progress. Now, the global industrial labor force accounts for more than 50% of the global population. Although the increase of labor costs has led to the slow growth of industrial output value, in general, the development of industry is a support for the growth of the world economy.

In addition, from the beginning of globalization, the degree of world unity has also been greatly improved, which is now very important in terms of economy and other aspects.
This also means that the development speed of the global economy has been greatly improved, so that the influence of globalization has become more and more powerful.
But I think that in the next 5 to 10 years, these "facts" will no longer exist - a new paradigm of globalization is taking shape. Under this paradigm, new technologies are changing the mode, participants, possibilities and even politics of trade.

对于经济的盛衰，也就是所谓的经济周期：由政令、消费者态度、资本支出，甚至太阳黑子和行星并列导致的货币供应变动、存货的多寡，以及世界贸易变化，人们已经提出了成百上千种理论。英国经济学家庇古将其简化为人类的平衡。庇古认为，经济的上下波动是由人类的过度乐观以及随后的过度悲观导致的。经济朝一头波动太远会有过剩，而朝另一头波动太远会有短缺。一个方向上的过度导致了另一个方向上的过度，如此往复，舒张和收缩永不停息。


在过去的 150 年里，全球化——产品、服务、数据、资金、劳动力的跨境流动的增长——已在整个世界刮起了旋风，横扫每一个国家、每一座城市和每一个家庭。这一切，还不到其极限。但在全球化未完成前，是有很多敌人的。为了获得长期的商业价值，必须先消灭这些敌人。

经历过战争、经济萧条和贸易保护主义的考验，全球化已变得不可战胜，屡次伴随着新的活力和影力回开反弹。就像第二次世界大战中，美国在太平洋战争中大胜一场，又在二战中不可阻挡地成为当时世界上最强大的国家。
经济霸权可以由一个小国瞬间变成庞然大物，也可以在短时间内倒向另一个更加强大的国家。
经济霸权之争，有时候其实只是其中一个国家的举手表决，却反而让其他人感到心惊胆颤。
得益于跨国公司及其全球供应链的推动，过去 30 年是全球化程度最高的一段时期。在这种模式下，公司从世界各地的供应商那里获取零部件和原材料，在墨西哥、中国和波兰这些低成本的制造中心将其组装为最终产品，然后出口到圣路易斯市的沃尔玛和旧金山市的苹果商店，售卖给那里的顾客。世界贸易组织在形容这种生产的全球化时指出，“中国制造”或“美国制造”已成过去式，现在只有“世界制造“


“世界制造”也被认为是一种“无政府主义”的制造，在工业化的发展中，国家之间的争端变得越来越少，而这种无政府主义的制造也成了一种“无政府主义”的制造。
所以，这个词并不是一种指代。在美国，“世界制造”是指美国人自己制造的产品，这些产品包括汽车、飞机、电脑、手机等等。在美国，“世界制造”被认为是一种指代。

我们所知道的全球化正逐渐消失在历史的长河中。揭示了正在进行的、由技术驱动的变革并不是小打小闹、各自为战。它们在改变全球化的整个范式，在改变存在已久的“事字”或者救一代人对全球化及其影响所抱有的传统观点。这些观点包括：庞大的全球供应链孕育出“世界制造”的产品；小企业出口难是因为固定成本高；边境贸易便利化是促进贸易量增加的关键；等等。过去 30 年，诸如此类的观点——所有这些当然是正确的，也得到了广泛的研究——影响了数以百计的重大贸易政策决定、数以千计的学术和政策论文、数不胜数的政策制定者和数千亿美元的发展援助。

但是，这些观点都存在一个致命的缺陷：他们从来没有考虑过一个更加重要的问题：
世界贸易为什么会变得越来越困难？
其实这是一个很简单的问题，我们只要想一想就能够得到答案：世界贸易的增长速度越来越快，而且贸易量也在增加。
这是一个非常重要的问题，因为它关系到我们是否能够掌握世界经济的走向。

大部分的学者认为，世界经济的增长速度是缓慢的。
不过，从另一个角度来看，我们现在已经能够解释为什么经济增长速度会快起来。
原因有两个：第一，在全球化的过程中，我们在工业和农业方面取得了非常重要的成就。
比如在全球化的过程中，工业获得了巨大的发展，现在在全球的工业用工量占到了全球总人口的百分之五十以上。虽然人工成本的增加，导致工业产值增长缓慢，但总体来说，工业的发展是对世界经济增长的一个支撑。
另外，从全球化开始，世界的统一程度也是有巨大提高的，现在不论是从经济还是从其他方面来看，这都是非常重要的。
这也就意味着，全球经济的发展速度在大幅提高，以至于全球化的影响力变得越来越强大。

但我认为，在接下来的 5~10 年里，这些“事实”将不复存在—一种崭新的全球化范式正在形成。在此范式下，新技术正在改变贸易的模式、参与者、可能性，甚至政治。

We can call this new wave of globalization that has begun to emerge "Globalization 4.0". However, compared with the globalization of your grandfather and even your father's era, the new globalization has undergone great changes: the driving mode has changed from global enterprise supply chain to online platforms, such as Alibaba, Amazon, MereadoLibre (a well-known e-commerce platform in Latin America), Jumia (a well-known e-commerce platform in Africa) and eBay, which connect hundreds of millions of individual buyers and sellers; The leading mode has changed from large chain retail stores to hundreds of millions of consumers who use smart phones to order products and services delivered to their homes; The measure of globalization is not the trade of physical products, but the cross-border flow of bits and bytes, that is, the trading of digital design, digital services and data; The mode of production has changed from manufacturing a large number of standardized products in countries with low labor force to designing and manufacturing personalized products on demand in small production units using 3D printing and robot technology close to end consumers; The obstacles faced have changed from paperwork and bureaucracy between countries to "last mile" distribution, network security challenges, and digital supervision that will increase the cost of enterprises' import and export trade.
In the 1930s, Ralph Nelson Eliot found that the stock market price moved and reversed in a recognizable pattern. The patterns he identified are repeated in form, but not necessarily in time or amplitude. Eliot separated five such patterns or "waves", which appear repeatedly in the market price. He named, defined and illustrated these patterns and their variants one by one. He then explained how they were connected to form a larger version of their own model, and how they were connected to form a larger level of the same model, and so on, which led to a structured price evolution. Eliot called this phenomenon wave theory.
Wave theory is a tool to study the price trend, and its main purpose is to predict the price trend. In this prediction, the prediction method of wave theory includes the following points:
1. Trend of price fluctuation: wave theory determines the trend of price fluctuation by calculating the time and space of price fluctuation, which is usually used for trend analysis and prediction.
2. Wave shape: wave theory identifies the possible reversal or adjustment of the market by comparing the shape of price fluctuations. For example, if the market is rising, the upward trend may continue, and if the market is falling, the trend may reverse.
3. Wave turning: The market may reverse or adjust, so wave theory usually predicts the turning point that the market may occur. For example, if the market is in an upward trend, the market may reverse, while if the market is in a downward trend, the market may reverse.
However, wave theory also has some defects. First, the prediction of wave theory usually takes a long time to verify. Secondly, the assumptions of wave theory are usually too idealistic, and the market may misjudge under some assumptions. Finally, the wave theory cannot fully reveal the movement track of the market. The changes of the market may be affected by many factors, such as market psychology and trading behavior. Therefore, although wave theory has its advantages, its role in market behavior still needs more research and analysis.

The main value of wave theory is that it provides a context for market analysis. This kind of relationship not only provides a basis for orderly thinking, but also provides a perspective for the overall position and prospects of the market. In many cases, its accuracy in identifying and even predicting market changes is almost unbelievable. Many aspects of human group activities conform to wave theory, but it is the most widely used in the stock market. In any case, the importance of the stock market for human living conditions is much more important than ordinary observers seem, or even those who rely on the stock market for a living seem. The overall price level of stocks is a direct and rapid evaluation of the total productivity of human beings. This kind of valuation has forms, and its far-reaching implications will eventually transform social science.

Wave theory is dominated by human social nature. Since human has such a nature, its expression has produced various forms. Because of the repetition of various forms, they have predictive value. Sometimes, the market seems to react to various external conditions and events, but at other times it will be indifferent to the causal conditions that most people think. The reason is that the market has its own laws. It is not driven by the external causality that people are accustomed to in their daily life experience. The price track is not the product of news. The market is not a cyclical machine, as some people say. Its movement reflects the repetition of various forms, which has nothing to do with the assumed causality and periodicity.


我们可以将这波已经开始涌现的新全球化浪潮称作“全球化 4.0”。但和你祖父甚至你父亲那个时代的全球化相比，新全球化发生了巨大的改变：驱动方式由全球企业供应链变为在线平台，如连接亿万个人买家和卖家的阿里巴巴、亚马逊、美多客（MereadoLibre，拉丁美洲地区的知名电商平台）、吉米亚(Jumia，非洲地区的知名电商平台）和易贝；主导方式由大型连锁零售店变为亿万消费者，他们使用智能手机订购送货上门的产品和服务；这种全球化的衡量方式不是实物产品贸易，而是比特和字节的跨境流动，也就是数字设计、数字服务和数据的买卖；生产方式由在劳动力低廉的国家制造大量标准化产品变为在小型生产单位用接近终端消费者的 3D 打印和机器人技术按需设计和制造个性化产品；面临的阻碍由国与国之间的文书工作、官僚作风变为“最后一公里”配送、网络安全挑战，以及会给企业进出口贸易增加成本的数字监管。


在20世纪30年代，拉尔夫·尼尔森·艾略特发现股票市场价格以可识别的模式（Pattern）趋势运动和反转。他辨别出的这些模式在形态（Form）上不断重复，但不一定在时间或幅度上重复。艾略特分离出了五种这样的模式或称“波浪”，它们在市场价格中反复出现。他给这些模式及其变体一一命名、定义并图解。他随后解释了它们如何连接在一起，形成它们自身模式的更大规模版本，以及它们是如何转而连接形成更大一级的相同模式，依此类推，这产生了结构化的价格演化。艾略特将这种现象称为波浪理论。

波浪理论是一种研究价格趋势的工具,其主要目的是预测价格的走势。在这种预测中,波浪理论的预测方法包括以下几点:

1. 价格波动的走势:波浪理论通过计算价格波动的时间和空间来确定其走势,这通常用于趋势分析和预测。

2. 波浪的形态:波浪理论通过比较价格波动的形态,识别市场可能出现的反转或调整。例如,如果市场正在上升,则上升趋势可能会继续,而如果市场正在下降,则趋势可能会逆转。

3. 波浪的转向:市场可能会出现反转或调整,因此波浪理论通常预测市场可能会出现的转折点。例如,如果市场正处于上升趋势中,则市场可能会出现反转,而如果市场正处于下降趋势中,则市场可能会出现反转。

然而,波浪理论也存在一些缺陷。首先,波浪理论的预测通常需要较长时间的时间来验证。其次,波浪理论的假设条件通常会过于理想化,市场可能会在一些假设条件下出现误判。最后,波浪理论并不能完全揭示市场的运动轨迹,市场的变化可能会受到很多因素的影响,如市场心理、交易行为等。因此,虽然波浪理论有其优越性,但其在市场行为中的作用仍然需要更多的研究和分析。


波浪理论的主要价值在于它为市场分析提供了一种前后关系。这种前后关系既为有条理的思考提供了基础，又为市场的总体位置及前景提供了一种视角。在很多时候，它识别甚至预测市场走向变化的准确性几乎让人难以置信。人类群体活动的许多方面符合波浪理论，但它在股市中的应用最为广泛。不管怎样，股市对于人类生存条件的重要性比普通观察者看上去的，甚至比那些依靠股市谋生的人看上去的重要得多。股票的总体价格水平是对人类总生产力直接且迅速的估价。这种估价有形态，其深远含意终将变革社会科学。

波浪理论由人的社会本性支配，既然人具有这样一种本性，因此其表达产生了各种形态。由于各种形态重复出现，所以它们有预测价值。有时，市场显得对各种外部条件和事件做出了反应，但在另一些时候它会对大多数人认为的因果条件无动于衷。其原因是市场有其自身的规律。它不受人们在日常生活经验中习以为常的外部因果关系驱动。价格轨迹不是消息的产物。市场也不像某些人说的那样，是台循环性的机器。它的运动反映了各种形态的重复出现，这种重复出现与假定的因果关系和周期性无关。


## 世界经济欣欣向荣?

20 世纪的全球化的表现形式，也就是全球供应链正从内部被反转。在产品方面，3D 打印和机器人技术正在帮助企业重新分工，并摆脱劳动力相对成本、供应商质量、标准化和规模经济的制约。生产的经济学正在改变：企业完全能从小规模的按需定制中获利。贸易成本将逐渐被降低：企业现在拥有由软件驱动的供应链，而且只要一台电脑和一台 3D 打印机就能办到。它将取代容易受到贸易摩擦、自然灾害、运输成本和不良供应商影响的实体供应链。
贸易不会结束，但其构成将发生变化——粮食、原材料以及经数字化设计和个性化定制的最终产品会越来越多。
服务贸易的走向则恰恰相反：企业把服务分拆给了国内外的服务提供商，这将加剧全球分工。新时代下，全球化可以更高效地运行。正如别针工厂的表现一样，厂家能提高生产率，终端消费者能以更优惠的价格获得更多的产品和服务，而专业供应商则能直接参与国际竞争，从而进一步专业化，孵化出全新的产业。

多年来，许多国际组织和专业人士一直警告可能会发生一场全球大流行。尽管如此，新冠肺炎疫情的暴发还是让全世界猝不及防。如今已是2022年，疫情暴发已两年有余，但这场大流行仍未结束。我们希望新冠肺炎疫情危机尽快过去，但是这能做到吗？世界卫生组织前任总干事曾表示，“疫情总有开始，也终将结束”[插图]。然而，从社会学和心理学层面来看，大流行并不会很快消失，而是会持续多年。一位研究科学和医学历史的专家表示：“我们生活在新冠肺炎疫情时代，我们不只是面对一场疫情危机，这次疫情还会带来许多重大而持久的变化。将来某一天，我们回望过去的时候，无法轻描淡写地表示‘那是一段艰难的时期，但一切都过去了’。实际上，疫情带来的许多影响需要几十年的时间才能逐步消除。”

![bee-7833738_960_720](vx_images/212774115248781.jpg)

确实如此！历史经验表明，我们很难预测一场大流行何时开始、何时结束，很难了解它如何能够结束，也很难评估它产生了哪些广泛的影响。纵观人类历史，虽然大流行的死亡率或感染率会逐渐降低，但其产生的影响将持续存在。随着社会经济的逐步调整，人们会努力回归正常生活，但大流行会继续影响人们的生活。

数千年来，大流行从来都不是偶发性危机，而是历史规律的产物。那么，历史经验如何帮助我们了解未来？从本质来看，大流行是冲击性事件，会造成社会鸿沟，给人们带来精神创伤，并加剧在人类历史上反复出现的基本相同的重大问题，如战争和冲突、不平等和贫困、社会凝聚力下降和社会冲突、政治动荡、供需关系遭到破坏以及债务困境等。


Such is the case! Historical experience shows that it is difficult to predict when a pandemic will start and end, to understand how it will end, and to assess its broad impact. Throughout human history, although the mortality or infection rate of the pandemic will gradually decrease, its impact will continue to exist. With the gradual adjustment of social economy, people will try to return to normal life, but the pandemic will continue to affect people's lives.
For thousands of years, pandemic has never been an accidental crisis, but a product of historical laws. So how can historical experience help us understand the future? In essence, a pandemic is an impact event, which will cause a social gap, bring psychological trauma to people, and exacerbate the basically same major problems that have repeatedly occurred in human history, such as war and conflict, inequality and poverty, decline in social cohesion and social conflict, political instability, damage to the relationship between supply and demand, and debt distress.
