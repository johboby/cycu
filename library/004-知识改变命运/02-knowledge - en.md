# Can knowledge really change fate?

Knowledge changes fate, learning mathematics, physics, and chemistry well, and traveling around the world is not afraid! Are these words very familiar? When we were young, we often listened to what our elders, especially our parents, always told us, but is this really the case?

From primary school to college graduation, and into social work, you will think about how much knowledge we have learned, and how many have we finally used in our work? And if 80% of what we have learned is useless knowledge, then what exactly is the reason why we have learned so much? Nowadays, many social phenomena are that a highly educated person is not as good as a porter, and a highly educated person has gone to work as a delivery clerk. An ordinary receptionist, such as Waseda, 985, or 211 University, is competing with you? Are you in a trance for a moment, what happened to the world? "Once upon a time, you should be proud of your education, but knowledge discovery has no use. Therefore, many people suffer from depression and choose to lie flat, choose to escape, choose to continue their studies to escape the injustice brought about by society and fate!"! Therefore, the phrase "knowledge changes fate" has been questioned by many people! So, can knowledge really change fate?

Destiny, a somewhat metaphysical term, appears in many success studies and personal professional courses, and is deeply loved by users. Why is this? Because, in the face of the unknown future, everyone wants to get a glimpse of the truth a bit earlier. Facing the current difficult and unbearable life, they always want to change it in various ways, which leads to the strange phenomenon of the present! Many young people are beginning to worship the Buddha, especially the God of Wealth rather than marriage. Primary school students are starting to dish up Buddhist beads. Is this really a good phenomenon? This is faith, or an escape, a spiritual sustenance.

Destiny, life, life+luck, some of which are brought to you by your original family, so a person born with a golden key may not have to do anything to reach a height that others have never been able to achieve in their lifetime of struggle, especially in terms of social status and wealth status; However, if you do not cherish and protect it, then luck will bring you back to civilian status overnight and lose everything. Everything comes from yourself.

##Recruitment of volunteers for the New General Education Learning Plan

The last second is anxious and irritable, as long as you change your mind, the next second is happy and happy (heaven), seeing a different world, meeting a different person, seeing different scenery along the way, and living a different life.

General education is the driving force behind the theory of civilization progress, which has also become the mainstream world view in the current world. That is, the progress of human civilization can change everything, and it has led most people without independent judgment to become supporters of the mainstream voice. The essence of culture is the collective expression of the survival structure. The thousands of diverse cultures presented over thousands of years of human civilization have long been considered antiques, which is a huge lack. We should put them back on a platform with mainstream culture, constantly comparing and questioning why our proud progress has led to the current intensifying cultural conflicts, survival crises, and trends.

Moreover, everyone's vision, vision, and mind are limited, and few are more rounded. Therefore, whoever thinks comprehensively and meticulously can understand the hidden connections of unrelated elements and aggregate them in a more ingenious way, who can become a more unicorn enterprise than the so-called unicorn now. We are not the creator, but a aggregator, a connector.
